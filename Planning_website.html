		<h4>Brief</h4>
		<p>I am making a pasta bar ordering system. It is based from the employes side and they are putting in each order that the customer that is meant to be over the phone is ordering. 
			Sprint one is a simple design where you have two options. Those two are that you are able to print the list of just the pastas and then the second option of quitting the program.

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>This sprint was very basic code and it just has would you like to review the list or would you like to stop the program. There are a lot of improvements that could be made to my code.
            Going forward I should focus on the styling a little bit more because when it prints out the pasta list it prints it not in a nice way. There isn't any features to add anything to the
			customer order in the future it should ask for the order and print the name of the resturant. It is very unformatted this version so I want the menu list to be more formatted and look nicer.

<h4>Reflection</h4>
<p>This sprint is still very basic and ther isn't any validation 
	In this sprint I added a feature where the user can add items to the order and added the function to the main list options. I also added some styling to the menu list by adding in the function print list with indexes. 
	There still is a lot of improvements going forward from this sprint. Next sprint I want to add a feature where you can review the order, the price of individual items, total price of overall order, each item and the quantity.
	In future sprints adding in validation is something very important but it can come later. Adding more customer and user peronilisation e.g. asking for customer name is coming up on the future sprints.

<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>In this sprint I added a feature where you can print out the customer order list after they ordered it. It prints the subtotal after each specific pasta item and then it counts up the price of the entire order list and gives the overall total.
	I started off by testing a pre written list so I could just print it out and test the individual function without making an order and a photo of that is shown above. This sprint still could have a bit more styling to it but I will sort that out later.
	I tested adding print_with_indexes thinking it would format better but it did not and it formatted really weirdly and it did not work how I wanted because the indexes did not format how I wanted it. Then I tried putting it in the subtotal and it came up with an error
	because I will have to create another function to format it correctly and I can not just use the previous function for the customer order list. A photo of the error is shown above.
	Then I decided I will fix that later because it was not working now and I will fix it when I fix the formatting in the next sprint or a future sprint focusing on the aesthetic side of my code and my ordering system, 
	In the end stages of the code this will most likely occur and I will spend some time making sure everything looks nice but for now I am focusing more on the content and the first layers of the code. 

	I probably should have shown more perseverance when trying to formant my customer list and realised I shouldn't have been lazy and I should have just created another function for it and I could have spend more time actually putting in effort trying to make it look good 
	but that will come eventually.

<p></p>
<img class="img-responsive" src="error_sprint_four.png" alt="Error picture for sprint four">
<p>For this error I thought i had to pass through variables in this line but I did not need to and I was passing through three variables but the code I wrote could not handle more than one.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A simimlar sort of idea was also why I had the errors in the screen shots shown above</p>

<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>This sprint I added a function that removed items from the customer list. I used the same temporary list as I used before to be able to test the function and how it works without having to create an order. I creates a funtion where you can print the customer order with indexes
	which I was trying to do last sprint but gave up and decided to do it later. I added this function to both the delete item from the list and the previous function I worked on being able to review the customer order.
	This sprint I had a lot of errors and photos are shown above. Figuring out how to remove a specific item  on the list was quite difficult and it is not yet validated as shown from a picture above. If i enter in 9 and there are 7 on the list it will change the order to negative two.
Validation not just for this sprint but for all functions will come in a future sprint. I also added a function to just edit the quantity of the pasta in the order to change the quantity without adding or subtracting.
This probably won't be used much but it is just a safety net where the ordering person can just quickly change their mistake and enter in the correct value if they subtracted or added too many dishes.
I got a lot done in this version. I added the print_with_indexes function in for the customer order that I was too lazy to do last version. I found that it was tricky trying to work out how to do the subtract function but in the end I managed to get it working.
