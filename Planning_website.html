	<h4>Brief</h4>
	<p>I am making a pasta bar ordering system. It is based from the employes side and they are putting in each order that the customer that is meant to be over the phone is ordering. 
        Sprint one is a simple design where you have two options. Those two are that you are able to print the list of just the pastas and then the second option of quitting the program.

<h1 id="Version_2">Version Two</h1>
<p><a href="data_bases/version_2.sqlite" class="btn">Version 2 Database</a></p>
<h3>Brief</h3>
<p>This version is split into two different tables. These two tables are the series table so that is all the information from the series including IMBD or age rating ect. The actor table incldes all the information about the actor.
	The purpose of this version to be able to make a database and be able to add new queries to it. I want to be able to get informaion across the two tables. 
	This is so that if actors for example Zendaya where she is in more than one TV show then her information doesn't have to be repeated.

<h1 id="Version_3">Version Three</h1>
<p><a href="data_bases/Version_3/Version_3.sqlite" class="btn">Version 3 Database</a></p>
<h3>Brief</h3>
<p>The aim for this version to have more information over a range of different items. This database should have more tables to connect to so then there are multiple different joins.
	There will be more of a range in queries that I can do since there are more tables. The variety should be greater as well because there are more sections.
