		<h3>Brief</h3>
		<p>I am making a pasta bar ordering system. It is based from the employes side and they are putting in each order that the customer that is meant to be over the phone is ordering. 
			There needs to be able to add and remove items from the list and get customer details from them, also asking if they want pickup or delivery. 

		</p>
		<h1>Relevant implications</h1>
		<h3>Usability</h3>
		<p>Usability is ensuring that the user can understand and use the program. The user should not be confused by the language and there isn’t any ‘tech’ language that the user would not be able to understand.
			To give appropriate feedback to the user when it is needed and prevent users being confused about what they need to do at each step. 
			This means I need to ensure that there are proper instructions for the user and if they need feedback that it is helpful for them to understand how the ordering system program works. 
			It needs to have some validation in place for error prevention and be able to communicate with the user when they have made an error, what they have done wrong, and how to fix it.
			Each option should be easy to understand for the user e.g. enter in a for add item to the customer order list.  
		</p>
		<h3>Functionality</h3>
		<p>
			The purpose of this relevant implication is making sure that the code actually works. That I have all my validation in where it is needed to be and it actually works and is function for an online ordering system.
			In order to do this you have to make sure that my the ordering system does not crash. I need to make sure that the program has no bugs or faults so it runs smoothly and doesn’t crash.
			It did not do incorrect maths when adding up the subtotals or overall total of the order. All items added to the separate lists e.g. customer order list will resets if the user requests to run again; all lists need to be emptied if user wants to order again. 
		</p>
		<h3>Sustaibility and future proofing</h3>
		<p>
			Sustainability and future proofing is guaranteeing that I have properly commented and doctyped my code. 
			This is so I could go back and look at previous code I have written and understand what is meant to happen and what I was writing.
			As well as that it is also if someone else were to look at my code they would understand how it works andbe able to give to another developer and them understand it quickly.
			This means that everything should appropriately commented before important functions/code and that every function is doctyped properly.
			This relevant implication is also for if I could add new features and/or functions to the code easily and I would not have to alter previous code at all or too much to add in new functionality for this code.

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>This sprint was very basic code and it just has would you like to review the list or would you like to stop the program. There are a lot of improvements that could be made to my code.
            Going forward I should focus on the styling a little bit more because when it prints out the pasta list it prints it not in a nice way. There isn't any features to add anything to the
			customer order in the future it should ask for the order and print the name of the resturant. It is very unformatted this version so I want the menu list to be more formatted and look nicer. 
			I learnt hoe to use the terminal and set up my project in terminal on my computer and on github online.

<h4>Reflection</h4>
<p>This sprint is still very basic and ther isn't any validation. Coming into this sprint I was a bit lost about how I would add items to the order and learnt about the empty list and how the user can add items to it during the code is running which I have not yet been familiar with and learnt how to do in this sprint.
	In this sprint I added a feature where the user can add items to the order and added the function to the main list options. I also added some styling to the menu list by adding in the function print list with indexes. 
	There still is a lot of improvements going forward from this sprint. Next sprint I want to add a feature where you can review the order, the price of individual items, total price of overall order, each item and the quantity.
	In future sprints adding in validation is something very important but it can come later. Adding more customer and user peronilisation e.g. asking for customer name is coming up on the future sprints.

<hr>

<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>In this sprint I added a feature where you can print out the customer order list after they ordered it. It prints the subtotal after each specific pasta item and then it counts up the price of the entire order list and gives the overall total.
	I started off by testing a pre written list so I could just print it out and test the individual function without making an order and a photo of that is shown above. This sprint still could have a bit more styling to it but I will sort that out later.
	I tested adding print_with_indexes thinking it would format better but it did not and it formatted really weirdly and it did not work how I wanted because the indexes did not format how I wanted it. Then I tried putting it in the subtotal and it came up with an error
	because I will have to create another function to format it correctly and I can not just use the previous function for the customer order list. A photo of the error is shown above.
	Then I decided I will fix that later because it was not working now and I will fix it when I fix the formatting in the next sprint or a future sprint focusing on the aesthetic side of my code and my ordering system, 
	In the end stages of the code this will most likely occur and I will spend some time making sure everything looks nice but for now I am focusing more on the content and the first layers of the code. 

	I probably should have shown more perseverance when trying to formant my customer list and realised I shouldn't have been lazy and I should have just created another function for it and I could have spend more time actually putting in effort trying to make it look good 
	but that will come eventually.

<p>For this error I thought I had to pass through variables in this line but I did not need to and I was passing through three variables but the code I wrote could not handle more than one.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A similar sort of idea was also why I had the errors in the screen shots shown above</p>

<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>This sprint I added a function that removed items from the customer list. I used the same temporary list as I used before to be able to test the function and how it works without having to create an order. I creates a funtion where you can print the customer order with indexes
	which I was trying to do last sprint but gave up and decided to do it later. I added this function to both the delete item from the list and the previous function I worked on being able to review the customer order.
	This sprint I had a lot of errors and photos are shown above. Figuring out how to remove a specific item  on the list was quite difficult and I had to learn about how to do it and apply it correctly to my code. It is not yet validated as shown from a picture above. If I enter in 9 and there are 7 on the list it will change the order to negative two.
Validation not just for this sprint but for all functions will come in a future sprint. I also added a function to just edit the quantity of the pasta in the order to change the quantity without adding or subtracting.
This probably won't be used much but it is just a safety net where the ordering person can just quickly change their mistake and enter in the correct value if they subtracted or added too many dishes.
I got a lot done in this version. I added the print_with_indexes function in for the customer order that I was too lazy to do last version. I found that it was tricky trying to work out how to do the subtract function but in the end I managed to get it working.

<hr>
<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>In this sprint I trialled a new way about how I could do my review customer order list to make the styling nicer. Now it is layed out nicer and prints the customer order nicer than the previous version did. 
	This version I did a lot of trial and error to make sure that the new layout for the I was going to do because I entered in each space that I left for each slot to fit in e.g. the name of the pasta, subtotal ect. I had a bit of guidence from my dad about how to do the nicer styling and the rjust code and learnt how to do it which is something I have not learnt before.
	I had an error when doing this which is shown above because I tried passing through an integer when it needed to be a string so to fix it I put str at the start of the variables that had integers e.g. the price of the individual pasta. 
	I also added in the pick up and delivery function to this sprint. I created a new list for the pickup and delivery details and I also had to append a $3 charge to the overall total.
	There weren’t any main problems with this code. Figuring out how to add a $3 charge to the total was a bit difficult because I had to realise that I needed to append it to the other list which counted up the overall total and not the pickup or delivery list.
	In my main project backlog it originally had that I was going to do pickup and delivery in sprint six but I decided to wait to do the validtiona dnd to do the pickup and delivery function now and do all the validation at the end.
	When testing the code it did crash when I entered characters to the integer(phone number) which is showing me where I need to go next and that I should start some validation. Nothing yet I validated apart from putting .upper() at the end of some lines of code so this is where to go next.

<hr>
<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>
	In this sprint is where I did the majority of my validation. The string validation had two parmeter variables being passed, it checked the maximum length and expected answer and I became more comfortable using while true loops for validation.
	I had not previously been very familiar with doing an expected answer for my validationa and used it effectively and learnt what it is and how to effectively apply it to my code. 
	I also did two different functions for integer and I used the try and except to capture the error if I wanted to. The first validated the value entered was an integer and then it validated the value is within a range of the minimum and maximum value.
	This function is used to check the number such as adding or removing the number of pastas in an order. The other get integer length function checks the answer is a integer and converts the number into a string then checks the length of the integer is within the minimum and maximum range.
	This is used for validating the phone numbers which the length need to be in the range of 9 to 12 digits. I trialed a new way for all the validation using while True loop function and used validating the actual number and not validating the length as I realised that I needed both functions.
	My first function could validate the phone number but the new get integer function would be used for checking the number of pastas to add or remove or to check when updating the order if the index value entered was correct.
	The subtraction function also didn’t check to see if the user was trying to subtract too many items in the custoemr order so would error if they were trying to remove too many, and if there were no more items for that type of pasta then the whole item would be removed from the order.
	Where to next: I need to add the confirm order and fully test all the different functions to make sure the validation is working correctly.

<h1 id="Sprint_7">Sprint seven</h1>
<h3>Brief</h3>
<p>This final sprint is to go though and test all my code to make sure there aren't any errors with it. I need to make my validation more extensive validation and check all of my prevous valdiation to se if it works. I also need to add in the confirm order function as a final thing to do.</p>

<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/S7_error_edit.png" alt="Picture of sprint six error">


<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>
	In this sprint I added confirm order, this is the final stage of ordering and confirm the details are correct and if they want to order again. If they want to order again I need to clear out the cart and pickup or delivery information and start again.
	If the user went into subtract pasta or edit order they would go into an endless loop because they had nothing to edit if they hadn’t added anything to the order so I added validation to check to see if they had anything in the customer order first to prevent the user from getting stuck in the loop.
	The validation for get string was harder to read than I thought so I changed around the code as I thought I had a minimum length check but did not so I added that in as well as a maximum string length and expected answers.
	I split out all the variables passed as required variables rather than using the * to allow for multiple variables. I added expected answer validation for each question that is asked including in main so that every question that can only have a selected number of answers is validated.
	

	In my code last year I had regex validation and I used similar structure to validate the name and allow only letters and a space in the name when entering the customer details and reject all other characters as they are invalid.
	I learned and applied doctyping in this sprint at the top of each function to document what it does and how the function can be used. 
The pickup or delivery needed a number of functions, to first print out what the pickup or delivery value was set to. 
Also if the user goes into pickup or delivery then the current option is replaced with the new option for pickup or delivery. I also found a bug during testing when they changed from a delivery to pickup then the delivery charge was still added to their order so I needed to remove the delivery change from the order when they changed to pickup.
I learnt what doctyping is in this sprint and where it should be used. A first I was intimated about what it could be but I quickly became used to it and what I needed to do and it was less daunting. I also had to add doing the confirm order in my main project backlog because I hadn't originally put it in and realised it was nessasary to do that.
</p>

<hr>
<h1 id="relevant_implications">Relevant Implications applying in my code</h1>
<h3>Usability</h3>
<p>How I addressed the usability in my pasta ordering system program is I added in validation functions to ensure that the code would not crash and the user would recive the proper error messages in this situations where they are needed.
	Validation was also making sure that the correct characters were used when they needed to be for example user only entered in letters for the name.
	In my error messages I made sure that they were specific to the situation and were clear for the user to understand what the mistake was and let them try again. 
	I used a very simple menu system which wouldn’t be confusing to the user to understand. It was similar to a home screen and after each function was used it would take the users back there. 
</p>

<h3>Functionality</h3>
<p>In order to make sure the functionality of my code was up to the standard I wanted was through multiple extensive tests. At the end of each sprint it could test each function to check if it would work as expected.
	Then in the later sprints when I started doing validation I tested my code a lot more to find all of the problems in my code and if it would work as I had hoped. 
	Multiple error messages are shown above in the planning and screen shots where I was testing and then fixed the errors that were in my code that now work.
	I also did a full test with a real life used which there is a video of on this website to show evidence of my code working in unpredictable conditions. 

</p>

<h3>Sustaibility and future proofing</h3>
<p>At the end of writing my code I fully commented everything, and before important code e.g. explaining what the if statements do making it clear to a developer if they were to read my code. 
	I also doctyped every function with a step by step explanation of what happens to make it very clear for anyone reading the code what happens. 
	This code is also very easy to add new functions to, all throughout the project I was easily able to add new functions to my main part of the code and did not have to change anything else from previous code. 
	Since it is a function based design it was easy to create more features to broaden what my ordering system. Each new function did not have an impact to previous functions and would not affect it in the future.

<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>Throughout this project I learnt a lot more about python and how to use functions for my code. I learnt how to build a program mostly off functions which is something I had not done before and different from last year.
	Adjusting to predominantly using functions was something that was different at first since my code last year only had a few functions now all I use was functions. I learnt about the terminal throughout this project. 
	I had not previously knew anything about git or github. I learnt about pushing my project from my computer to the github online website that I have. I changed the font size and colour of my terminal because I thought it looked nicer and the original size was small and I preferred having a larger font. 
	This is a really useful tool because I did not have to create new files for each sprint and it was secure once I had pushed my code so there was anything to happen to my computer I would have a way to get my code back. 
	Learning a bit about the agile project management was interesting to get to learn something that is so widely used in the workforce. Learning about sprints, and stand up meetings however much I didn’t like standing up for that long. 
	It was nice to check in with my class and  being able to learn about where my peers were up to and how they were feeling about the project. Having the structure of the agile framework helped me keep organised when it felt like a big project I could just focus on the smaller sprints and little goals.
	If I were to do this project again I would make sure to keep uploading my project to git. During the end of the project i got better at just uploading it once I had done something and not just at the end of the sprint and it could have been useful to upload it more often.
	I would also have a bit more perseverance after getting errors and being stuck because I would tend to overcomplicate things when I did not need to. A few positives from this project was getting to combine my love of pasta and a school project.
	I enjoyed having a real world example to base my project on like an ordering system. I did a lot of learning throughout this project which is discussed earlier and growing my knowledge for python which is pretty much another language is exciting.
